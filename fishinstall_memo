```
‚û§ opam init

<><> Required setup - please read <><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><>  üê´ 

  In normal operation, opam only alters files within ~/.opam.

  However, to best integrate with your system, some environment variables
  should be set. If you allow it to, this initialisation step will update
  your fish configuration by adding the following line to ~/.config/fish/config.fish:

    source /Users/ideyuta/.opam/opam-init/init.fish > /dev/null 2> /dev/null; or true

  Otherwise, every time you want to access your opam installation, you will
  need to run:

    eval $(opam env)

  You can always re-run this setup with 'opam init' later.

Do you want opam to modify ~/.config/fish/config.fish? [N/y/f]
(default is 'no', use 'f' to choose a different file)
